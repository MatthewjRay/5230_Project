# Text Classification Assignment: Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

The goal of this assignment is to implement and compare three text classification algorithms—
Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)—on the NLTK Movie Reviews
dataset. You will explore the impact of using both raw Term Frequency (TF) and Term Frequency-
Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) as feature representations.
