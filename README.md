# Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Implementation and Evaluation on NLTK Dataset

The primary goal of this assignment is to implement the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)
algorithm for tokenization and assess its performance using a NLTK dataset, with a focus on
books. Additionally, you will create a reference tokenization using NLTK's punkt tokenizer for
comparative analysis.

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
  - jupyter
  - regex
  - nltk=3.8.1
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - pandas
  - tabulate
  - seaborn

### Installing
Use the .yml file to create an env 

```bash
conda env create -f <path_to_yaml_file>
```
Activate the newly create env
```bash
conda activate env
```
### Executing Program

In your active env run the code to open NLP_Assignment1_TextClassification_MRay.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.  

```python
jupyter notebook NLP_Assignment1_TextClassification_MRay.ipynb
```

Run the code in Jupyter Notebook.
